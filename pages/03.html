                <h1>Tsunoda hopeful RB changes can bring 'winning mindset' as team hold lofty ambitions</h1>
                <hr>
                <section class="news-one">
                    <img src="../imagines/news/yukicar.avif" alt="yuki car" width="500">
                    <p>Yuki Tsunoda has declared himself “excited” by the changes within RB ahead of the 2024 season –
                        while
                        also revealing his lofty hopes that those changes will lead to the team battling with sister
                        squad
                        Red Bull Racing in the coming seasons.</p>
                    <p>The squad, formerly known as AlphaTauri, have undergone a massive overhaul, with new CEO Peter
                        Bayer
                        joining last year, while former Ferrari Sporting Director Laurent Mekies has come in as Team
                        Principal to replace the retiring Franz Tost.</p>
                    <p>But the new additions haven’t stopped there, with Alan Permane – who left Alpine last summer –
                        joining as Racing Director, while Tim Goss joins from the FIA to fill the newly-created role of
                        Chief Technical Officer. There have also been moves to align RB more closely with their sister
                        team
                        Red Bull, with departments at their Bicester headquarters due to move to new facilities in
                        Milton
                        Keynes.</p>
                    <p>For Tsunoda, who is about to embark on his fourth season in F1 with the outfit, the changes have
                        been
                        resoundingly positive, even without Tost at the helm – an individual who had a huge influence on
                        the
                        Japanese driver’s career in the sport.</p>
                </section>
                <hr>
                <section class="news-one">
                    <p>“Lots of things changed,” said Tsunoda following the launch of RB’s car, the VCARB 01. “First of
                        all,
                        the Team Principal, CEO, the structure itself of the team – pretty much all of it has changed
                        and I
                        think it’s definitely a big project that they’re thinking, and especially with Laurent.</p>
                    <p>“I like his ferocity, what he wants to achieve in the team and also for the future as well. I’m
                        looking forward to it.</p>
                    <p>“It won’t be easy, but I’m happy and I’m excited to be in that part of the project and hopefully
                        I
                        can support as much as possible to progress as a team. Definitely, I miss Franz as well but I'm
                        also
                        looking forward to this big project.”</p>
                    <p>While the behind-the-scenes overhaul could signal an exciting future for RB, Tsunoda is also
                        hoping
                        they can help make him an even better driver in the short-term.</p>
                    <p>“I got good training last year – a couple of drivers changed next to myself – so adapting to new
                        environments, it was already good training last year so I don’t have much surprise or confusion
                        yet,” said Tsunoda assessing how he would handle the changes at RB, and referencing the three
                        team
                        mates who drove alongside Tsunoda in 2023.</p>
                    <p>“But at the same time, the people who are coming into the team have lots of experience – for
                        example
                        Alan [Permane] as well – and I think that kind of new blood will also give me good progress and
                        also
                        good knowledge to become an even better driver.</p>

                    <p>“Especially Alan, he won a championship in the past with Renault, and that winning mindset –
                        definitely we need that in our team.</p>
                    <p>“We’re aiming for not just being top 10, hopefully at some point we can fight against Red Bull.
                        So, I think we’ll be good and we’ll make it work.”</p>
                    <p>While targeting a battle with their sister team in the future represents the ambition within RB,
                        regarding where they want to be in 2024, Tsunoda was also relishing the prospect of working more
                        closely with the team who have dominated the past two F1 seasons.</p>
                    <p>“It will be nice that we will be able to work slightly more together, closer to Red Bull Racing,”
                        said the 23-year-old.</p>
                    <p>“They achieved a lot of things in the past, and in recent years they’re just dominating, it feels
                        as well. But obviously there are regulations about how much we can work together and obviously
                        it’s the same as others I guess.</p>
                    <p>“So we’ll see how much we can work closer but at the same time, it’s definitely positive signs
                        that we are able to have a bit of knowledge from the winning car as well.”</p>
