                                <p>Red Bull were a truly dominant force in 2023, with the team claiming victory at 21
                                        out of 22 races. Nineteen of these victories belonged to Max Verstappen, who
                                        clinched his third drivers’ title in record-breaking fashion. Can the squad
                                        repeat this level of success? Here’s the lowdown on the reigning world champions
                                        ahead of the 2024 F1 season…</p>

                        <h2>Drivers for 2024</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <section class="news-one">
                        <p> <strong> Max Verstappen </strong>#1: 3 world championships, 54 wins, 32 pole positions, 98
                                podiums, 2586.5 points, 185 starts</p>
                        <p><strong>Sergio Perez</strong> #11: 6 wins, 3 pole positions, 35 podiums, 1486 points, 258
                                starts</p>
                        <p>Max Verstappen enters into his ninth season as a Red Bull driver with his name firmly etched
                                into the history books. After being promoted to the team back in 2016 following a
                                promising start to his F1 career with Toro Rosso, the then-18-year-old memorably won on
                                his debut at the Spanish Grand Prix.</p>
                        <p>Verstappen secured his first world championship in 2021 and followed this up with further
                                titles in 2022 and 2023, in the process taking his win tally up to 54. With the Dutchman
                                signed to Red Bull through to the end of 2028, those statistics could reach even dizzier
                                heights in the future.</p>
                        <p>Sergio Perez joined the Milton Keynes-based squad in 2021, having raced for the likes of
                                Sauber, McLaren and Force India in the years prior. Now going into his fourth campaign
                                with Red Bull, the Mexican is looking to build more consistency in 2024 and seal his
                                place as Verstappen’s team mate in 2025.</p>

                        <section class="news-one">
                                <img src="../imagines/news/redbullaaaa.avif" alt="redbull on track" width="500">
                        <p>The 2023 season could barely have gone any better for Red Bull. They very quickly left the
                                rest of the field in their wake, with Verstappen and Perez taking two wins apiece in the
                                opening four Grands Prix.</p>
                        <p>Verstappen then embarked on an incredible winning streak that saw him claim 10 victories in a
                                row between Miami and Monza. The run was broken by Carlos Sainz’s win in Singapore, the
                                only non-Red Bull race victory of the year in what was the team’s toughest weekend.</p>
                        <p>While Perez struggled to find consistency as the season progressed, Verstappen sealed the
                                world title in the Qatar Sprint with six races left to spare. Perez ultimately did
                                enough to help the team clinch their first 1-2 in the drivers’ championship, while the
                                outfit took the constructors’ title with a whopping 451-point advantage over Mercedes in
                                P2.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <section class="news-one">
                        <p>The outfit now known as Red Bull have their origins in the Stewart Grand Prix team, which was
                                founded by Jackie Stewart and his son Paul. After a three-year stint between 1997 and
                                1999, Ford purchased the team and they became Jaguar Racing in 2000.</p>
                        <p>Jaguar struggled to make a mark in the five years that followed, leading to the Red Bull
                                drinks company taking over in 2005. The brand had previously acted as a sponsor to the
                                Sauber outfit before starting life as their own team.</p>
                        <p>Since then Red Bull have achieved 113 race wins and 264 podiums, as well as six constructors’
                                championships and seven drivers’ titles.</p>
                        </section>
                        <h2>Greatest achievement</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <section class="news-one">
                        <p>Soon after securing their first race victory in 2009, Red Bull went on to enjoy a period of
                                huge success between 2010 and 2013, where the winning partnership between the team and
                                Sebastian Vettel secured four consecutive constructors’ and drivers’ championships.</p>
                        <p>However, this achievement is surely rivalled by the team’s unprecedented level of dominance
                                in 2023, marking their third drivers’ title in a row and second constructors’ crown.

                        <h2>One key goal for 2024</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <section class="news-one">
                        <p>Given their staggering record in 2023, it may be difficult to find an area for Red Bull to
                                improve in 2024. But the team will not be resting on their laurels as they look to
                                maintain their advantage over an increasingly competitive field in the year ahead.</p>
                        <p>Verstappen has spoken of the RB19 being less strong on street tracks and this is a weakness
                                that the squad will look to work on for their new car.</p>
                        <p>And in terms of driver performance, Perez will also need to up his game, particularly when it
                                comes to qualifying. The Mexican often gave himself extra work to do on Sundays in 2023
                                by starting from a lower-than-expected grid slot, so the team will be expecting some
                                better Saturdays from Perez in 2024.</p>
