            <h3>Bahrain International Circuit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 5.412km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 57</li>
                <li>Race distance: 308.238km</li>
                <li>Lap record 1:31.447 - De la Rosa(2005)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Ground was broken for the Bahrain International Circuit in December 2002. Like the Yas Marina Circuit in
                Abu
                Dhabi, the developers had a blank, sandy canvas to work with, and with that fashioned the technical,
                5.4km
                track designed by Hermann Tilke.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>It was 2004 when the drivers first lined up under an unusually cloudy sky for the inaugural Bahrain Grand
                Prix. The race was dominated (like many in 2004) by the two Ferraris, with Michael Schumacher winning
                out
                from Rubens Barrichello, while the crowds were also treated to a fantastic dog-fight between the Jaguar
                of
                Mark Webber and the Renault of Fernando Alonso.</p>
            <h3>What’s the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>You can usually expect great racing and decent amounts of overtaking in Bahrain, while the drivers have
                to
                contend with wind, racing under floodlights and the difficulty of finding a decent set-up with the wide
                temperature fluctuations between sessions. The track’s most challenging point is the tight, downhill,
                off-camber Turn 10 left-hander, while the fast run through Turn 12 is another highlight, allowing the
                racers
                to really feel their cars coming alive.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Given the nature of the track, race-goers in Bahrain have always got a decent chance of being treated to
                a
                'duel in the desert' or three. Away from the race track, Bahrain, as you might expect, is a great place
                to
                catch some rays, with the 33-island archipelago kingdom featuring some jaw-dropping resorts. And if you
                want
                to do some racing yourself, the Bahrain International Karting Circuit, located right next to the track,
                is
                one of the world’s top karting facilities.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Your options are slightly limited in Bahrain, given that the organisers understandably don’t want loads
                of
                fans having to traipse out into the middle of a hot desert to watch the action! We reckon your best bet
                is
                to get a place in the Batelco grandstand, giving you a great view of cars charging into Turn 8,
                hammering
                through 9 and 10 and then passing you on the run down to the short-apex Turn 11.</p>

            <h2>Saudi Arabia - Jeddah Corniche Circuit </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trackone">
            <img src="../imagines/circuit/saudiarabia.png" alt="saudiarabia" width="400">
            <ul>
                <li>First Grand Prix: 2021</li>
                <li>Circuit Length: 6.174km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 50</li>
                <li>Race distance: 308.45km</li>
                <li>Lap record: 1:30.734 Lewis Hamilton (2021)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is, you won’t be surprised to hear, a temporary street circuit (albeit
                adorned
                with some permanent sections), located on the Corniche – a 30km coastal resort area of the ancient Saudi
                Arabian city of Jeddah. Designed by the Tilke company, in conjunction with Formula 1’s own Motorsports
                team
                – who used Google Earth for their initial investigations into potential layouts – F1’s Ross Brawn said
                of
                the track: “What we want to see is a race circuit. We don’t want Mickey Mouse circuits. We don’t want
                those
                old classic street circuits with 90 degree turns. We want fast sweeping circuits, circuits which are
                going
                to challenge the drivers – and they are going to love it.”</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>The inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix took place in 2021, the race joining its Middle Eastern
                counterparts
                in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi – while like those races, the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix also takes place under
                floodlights.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Fast. Very fast. Average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are around 250km/h – quicker than
                those at
                Silverstone, and second on the 2021 calendar only to Monza – aka ‘The Temple of Speed’. It is, quite
                simply,
                the fastest street circuit ever seen in Formula 1 – while the track also features the most corners on
                the
                calendar with 27, many of them quick, sinuous bends as the drivers wend their way along the Jeddah
                waterfront.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix promises a sun-soaked festival of Formula 1, located on an idyllic stretch
                of
                the Kingdom’s coastline. The on-track action is stunning, as the drivers get to grips with this rapid
                street
                track, while Jeddah itself comes alive as the city revels in hosting the F1 circus.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>The average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are such that any grandstand provides a spectacular
                viewing location. Nonetheless, the gladiatorial splendour of the grandstand surrounding the banked Turn
                13
                corner makes for a very special spot for F1 fans.</p>

            <h2>Australia - Melbourne</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trackone">
            <img src="../imagines/circuit/australia.avif" alt="australia circuit" width="400">

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 5.303km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 58</li>
                <li>Race distance: 307.574km</li>
                <li>Lap record: 1:24.125 - M. Schumacher (2004)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The deal to host Formula 1 in Melbourne was done in 1993, with the decision taken to create a circuit
                using a
                mixture of the existing roads around the city’s Albert Park – mainly Aughtie Drive and Lakeside Drive if
                you
                fancy driving it yourself – with a little detour through the Lakeside Stadium’s car park.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Just four months after Adelaide held its last Australian Grand Prix at the end of 1995, the Formula 1
                teams
                were back in Australia for Melbourne's first Grand Prix at the start of 1996. That race is most often
                remembered for Martin Brundle’s infamous Jordan crash at Turn 3 after he launched himself off the back
                of
                Johnny Herbert’s Sauber.</p>
            <h3>What’s the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>As a temporary facility, Albert Park can be quite bumpy, while the circuit at the start of the weekend is
                often slippery, rubbering in as the sessions progress. It’s also a circuit that requires a well-sorted
                chassis, with several spots on the track where the drivers require a reactive front end to allow them to
                chuck it into a corner – the main one being the rapid Turn 11-12 chicane. Melbourne is also one of the
                faster tracks on the calendar, with Lewis Hamilton’s 2018 pole lap set at an average of 235km/h.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Often found on lists of the world’s best cities, Melbourne is a blast all year round – and it only gets
                better when Formula 1 rolls into town. There are bars and restaurants aplenty, you’re right by the
                beach,
                while the race’s appearance at the start of Australia’s autumn means the temperatures should be peachy.
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>If you want to get in a grandstand, opt for either the Waite stand overlooking Turn 12, or the Brabham
                Grandstand on the outside of Turn 2 to watch cars jostling for position through the first chicane.
                Alternatively, there are some nice general admission spots on the far side of the lake – go for either
                around Turns 9-10 or 11-12 if you fancy some F1 picnic feels.</p>

                <li>Lap record: 1:30.983 - Hamilton (2019)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>In 1962. Soichiro Honda, whose car company you may have heard of, was a man with big ambitions. Seeking
                to turn Honda into an automotive powerhouse, he decided his company should have its own test track.
                Dutchman John Hugenholtz got the nod, and drew up the now-iconic ‘crossover’ Suzuka track – although
                original drawings saw the track pass over and under itself a full three times, which would have been
                sweet!</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Despite most people agreeing that Suzuka is a worthy successor to sliced bread in the ‘Best Thing’
                stakes, the Japanese track was a relative latecomer to the F1 calendar, making its first appearance in
                1987. Nigel Mansell would remember that weekend well, after he suffered a crash in qualifying that ruled
                him out of the race, gifting that year’s championship to his bitter rival Nelson Piquet.</p>
            <h3>What’s the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Show us a racing a driver who doesn’t love Suzuka, and we’ll show you a liar. The high-speed track
                remains one of the ultimate driving challenges, with the snaking ‘S’ Curves, the two
                commitment-rewarding Degners and the white-knuckle ride of 130R all highlights in a series of highlights
                at what is one of F1’s seminal tracks. And hey, it’s got a crossover, which is always cool, right?</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>A track that has witnessed an unfair share of legendary F1 moments (not least between Messrs Prost and
                Senna), a unique set of fans with an unabashed commitment to playing Formula 1 dress-up, a Ferris wheel,
                and great food. Okay, for most of us it’s a long slog to get there, but surely a better question is:
                ‘Why not go?’</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Take your pick. Grandstands D and E overlook the ‘S’ Curves, giving you an amazing chance to watch
                downforce and commitment working in perfect harmony as the drivers negotiate the sinuous turns.
                Elsewhere, the left flank of Grandstand G places you at the inside of 130R, which should be a bit of a
                treat, while if it’s overtaking you want, Grandstand I will give you a view of the incident-attracting
                Hairpin.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 5.451km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 56</li>
                <li>Race distance: 305.066km</li>
                <li>Lap record: 1:32.238 - M. Schumacher (2004)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>In April 2003, a marshland in the Jiading District of Shanghai was earmarked for Formula 1 greatness.
                Eighteen months and around $450 million later, the state-of-the-art Shanghai International Circuit was
                complete.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>The 2004 season featured two new races, one of which was the Chinese Grand Prix (the other was Bahrain).
                If either were added to try and stop Ferrari from winning everything, however, it didn’t work –
                Schumacher won in Bahrain, while Rubens Barrichello triumphed in China.</p>
            <h3>What’s the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>The circuit’s pleasing form when seen from the air – it’s designed to look like the Chinese symbol for
                ‘shang’, meaning upwards – is equally pleasing to the drivers on terra firma. There’s a unique start to
                the lap as the drivers fly into the ever-tightening Turns 1 and 2, before they dart left through 3 and
                4. The super-high g force Turns 7 and 8 are loved by the drivers, while the circuit also features one of
                the longest straights on the calendar, the 1.2km stretch that separates Turns 13-14.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Shanghai has expanded itself into one of the world’s most dynamic and lively cities since the start of
                the millennium, making it an awesome F1 tourist stop. The sprawling Pudong district is chock full of hip
                bars and amazing restaurants. Then when it’s time to go racing, just hop on the Shanghai Metro’s Line 11
                and get off at the Shanghai Circuit stop 60 minutes later.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>We’re going to recommend Grandstand K, overlooking the Turn 14-15 hairpin, where you’ll be in the best
                seats to watch all the overtaking. Alternatively, head for Turn 6, the track’s other best passing spot,
                where Daniel Ricciardo sealed his 2018 win with a brave move on Valtteri Bottas.</p>

            <h2>Miami International Autodrome</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trackone">

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 5.412km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 57</li>
                <li>Race distance: 308.326km</li>
                <li>Lap record: 1:29.708 - Max Verstappen (2023)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Having made its F1 debut in May 2022, the Miami International Autodrome is a temporary circuit, but one
                designed to have a permanent feel. Set in the Hard Rock Stadium complex in Miami Gardens, home to the
                NFL’s famous Miami Dolphins franchise, the track is the culmination of a development process that
                simulated no less than 36 different layouts before settling on a thrilling, 19-turn lap that provides a
                street circuit vibe, not dissimilar to Melbourne’s Albert Park.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>The inaugural Miami Grand Prix took place in 2022, the Florida race joining its Texan counterpart in
                Austin to become the second US race on the calendar – and the 11th different American venue to host a
                round of the Formula 1 world championship.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>A street-track spectacular. With the Hard Rock Stadium at its epicentre, the 5.41km layout features 19
                corners, three straights, three DRS zones, and top speeds of over 340km/h. There are elevation changes
                too, the main one found between Turns 13 and 16, with the track heading over an exit ramp and under
                various flyovers across uneven ground. The Turn 14-15 chicane, meanwhile, has an uphill approach, with a
                crest in the middle, and then drops down on exit.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>The Hard Rock Stadium knows how to put on a show – it has hosted six Super Bowls, two Baseball World
                Series and numerous rock concerts. Put it at the heart of a track designed to encourage close racing
                while meeting the highest safety standards and you have a sure-fire winner for spectators. Then there’s
                Miami itself – famed for its sandy beaches, art deco vibe, vibrant multiculturalism and rich sporting
                heritage, it’s an essential destination for those visiting the Sunshine State.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>When viewing a sporting event in a purpose-built stadium, it’s hard to go wrong. In fact, you could walk
                around the top deck of the Hard Rock Stadium and see every corner of the track – pretty unique. As for
                the best passing spots, a seat near Turns 1, 11 or 17 should put you in the thick of the action.</p>

                <li>Number of laps: 63</li>
                <li>Race distance: 309.049km</li>
                <li>Lap record: 1:15.484 - Lewis Hamilton (2020)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Imola – or the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari as it’s been known since 1988 – had its
                foundation stone laid in March 1950. It was ready for testing by October 1952, while racing began at the
                circuit in 1953.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Imola first hosted a non-championship F1 race in 1963, but it would take some politicking with Monza in
                1980 before the track was awarded the honour of hosting the Italian Grand Prix for the first time that
                year. From 1981, the two tracks worked together in perfect harmony, with Imola taking on its famous ‘San
                Marino’ title, and going on to host a total of 27 Grands Prix up until 2006. It returned as venue for
                the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in 2020.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>A thrill ride. After testing his AlphaTauri AT01 at the track in the build-up to the 2020 season, Pierre
                Gasly called the experience one of the best he’d ever had in a Formula 1 car, while his then-team mate
                Daniil Kvyat remarked that “an F1 car through corners like Acque Minerali – the entrance is so fast,
                it’s so cool. It really gives you a lot of adrenaline.” The anti-clockwise circuit is certainly fast,
                with an old-school feel as the drivers put it on the line in iconic corners like the aforementioned
                Acque Minerali and Piratella.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Like neighbouring Mugello, Imola is nestled in a fantastic part of the world, with the Tuscan hills to
                the south, the Adriatic beaches to the east and the gastronomic delights of cities like Bologna, Parma
                and Modena to the west – as well as the F1 mecca that is Ferrari’s HQ in nearby Maranello. There’s also
                no getting around the fact that a visit to Imola is an opportunity for F1 fans to pay their respects to
                Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, who lost their lives at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>The stand on the outside of Acque Minerali is a great spot to see an F1 machine being pushed to its
                absolute limits, as the drivers struggle to get the cars down to speed for the tight right-hander before
                blasting back up the hill to the Variante Alta chicane.</p>

            <h2>Monaco - Monte Carlo</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trackone">

                <li>Circuit length: 3.337km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 78</li>

                <li>Lap record: 1:14.260 - Max Verstappen (2018)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>In 1215, sort of – that’s when Monaco was first established as a colony of Genoa.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>It was 1929 when racing engines first reverberated around the Principality, after cigarette manufacturer
                Antony Noghes decided to organise a race with his pals from the Automobile Club de Monaco. The race was
                part of the calendar in the first year of the Formula 1 World Championship in 1950, and hasn’t been off
                it since 1955.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Incredibly narrow and totally iconic. Nelson Piquet memorably described driving around Monaco as “like
                riding a bicycle around your living room”… which is fair. Despite that, it’s a challenge that nearly all
                drivers love, forcing them to put their skills on the line and rewarding millimetric accuracy.
                Overtaking on the tight streets is harder, however, with the 2003 Grand Prix witnessing a grand total of
                zero passing moves!</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>A holiday on the French Riviera, plus the chance to watch Formula 1 cars pounding past places where
                Monegasques usually go to buy a pint of milk? It really is as fun as it sounds. On top of that, the
                chance to walk the track after a day’s hard lapping – or even enjoy your dinner on it at one of the
                terrasse bars – is not to be missed.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Assuming you can’t get into one of the overhanging apartment blocks around the circuit (or onto a boat)
                shoot for anything from Grandstands L to P, which are clustered around the Swimming Pool section of the
                track, and where drivers hurl their cars through the tight chicane at 200km/h. Or, for a more
                spectacular vista, try Grandstand B, overlooking the ritzy Casino Square.

            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The man-made Notre Dame Island in the middle of the St Lawrence River was created for the 1967 Expo 67
                World's Fair. Once the expo and the ensuing 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics had left town, some clever
                people decided to make a race track out of the island’s roads. And lo, the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame, as it
                then was, came to be.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>With the Canadian Grand Prix having been in search of a permanent home for a number of years in the 1960s
                and 1970s, the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame first hosted the race in 1978. Fittingly, Gilles Villeneuve
                claimed his maiden win, at the track that would end up bearing his name.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>The fast, low-downforce circuit is one of the drivers’ favourites. The track is quite stop-start, with
                lots of heavy-braking chicanes and the famous hairpin to get the anchors working hard. Out of the
                corners, though, the track is quick and flowing, while the most iconic piece of the circuit comes right
                at the end of the lap: the Wall of Champions, so-called after excursions into it from Damon Hill,
                Jacques Villeneuve and Michael Schumacher during the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix weekend.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>The Montrealais really embrace their Grand Prix weekend, with the charming city turning into an F1-loving
                party town in the week leading up to the race. For the Grand Prix itself, the leafy setting makes the
                Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve one of Formula 1’s most laidback venues.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>It’s got to be one of either Grandstand 15, 21 or 24, the three that surround the hairpin. It makes for a
                real amphitheatre vibe down there, as well as allowing you to see all the hairpin overtakes.

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built as part of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics development
                programme. The foundation stone was laid in 1989, while the first car race was a round of the 1991
                Spanish Touring Car Championship.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Two weeks after the touring cars raced at Barcelona, it was Formula 1’s turn. The track enjoyed a
                sensational debut, with Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna’s famous eyeball-to-eyeball drag race down the
                straight, before Mansell took the lead and drove on to victory.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>The drivers love the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, which is just as well, because they spend huge
                amounts of time pounding around it during winter testing. The track is a good mix of high- and low-speed
                corners, with the challenging Turn 3 right-hander a great chance to evaluate the balance of the car your
                team’s designers have given you to fight with for the season.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>You don’t need us to tell you that Barcelona is one of the world’s great cities, even if we just sort of
                did. Food, culture, beaches – it’s all there, making a Spanish Grand Prix holiday a properly attractive
                proposition.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>You’ve got plenty of choice, with almost the whole track overlooked by grandstands or general admission
                areas. On the outside of Turn 1, Grandstand A will let you see the best overtaking spot on the track,
                while the general admission area around Turn 3 will provide the awe-inspiring sight of Formula 1 cars
                being pushed to the limit of their downforce capabilities.

                <li>Lap record: 1:06.957 - Raikkonen (2018)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The fearsome, original Osterreichring was originated in 1969 as a replacement for the Zeltweg airfield
                circuit. The track known today as the Red Bull Ring was more or less created over the winter of 1995-6,
                when Hermann Tilke was engaged to turn the Osterreichring into a shorter, more modern race track.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>The A1-Ring, as it was then called, was opened in 1996, with Formula 1 arriving at the circuit a year
                later. Jacques Villeneuve won the race, while Jean Alesi had a spectacular crash when his Benetton
                climbed up the Ferrari of Eddie Irvine. Alesi’s team mate Gerhard Berger, meanwhile, used his home Grand
                Prix to announce his F1 retirement.</p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>It’s only wee, bless it, but the Red Bull Ring packs a lot into a short lap. The first half rewards
                power, as the cars blast along three straights separated by a pair of uphill right-handers. But then as
                the drivers work their way downhill, the circuit becomes a regular toboggan ride, as the cars canyon
                through a series of quick corners, including the exhilarating Rindt right-hander, named for Austria’s
                first F1 champion.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Race tracks don’t come much more picturesque than the Red Bull Ring, set in an idyllic natural bowl in
                the Styrian mountains. That makes for a pleasant environment for a Grand Prix, while if you’re after
                tourist attractions to visit after the race, look no further than the museum in Graz dedicated to the
                city’s favourite son: Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>One of Formula 1’s best views is to be had at the Red Bull Ring’s ‘Nord’ grandstand, based around the
                outside of what used to be the Bosch Kurve at the Osterreichring. Here, you’ll have a great vantage
                point across much of the track as it drops away from you down the natural slope of the circuit.

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 5.891km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 52</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Little did those laying the perimeter road to the RAF Silverstone airfield in 1942 know that they were
                setting down what would become one of the world’s greatest race tracks. But, well, they were! The
                Silverstone circuit was first used for a proper motor race in 1947 – although sadly, a local sheep lost
                its life during the proceedings…

                </h3>
            <p>Silverstone was the first Grand Prix, hosting the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship round on May 13
                1950. Old campaigner Giuseppe Farina, who’d take that year’s title, won the race in his Alfa Romeo 158.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>At the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton compared a flat-out lap around Silverstone to flying a
                fighter jet, which should tell you all you need to know about the Northamptonshire circuit. Despite
                numerous layout changes over the years, Silverstone has always maintained its essential character as one
                of the fastest tracks on the F1 calendar, while historic corners like Maggotts, Becketts and Abbey
                provide some of the biggest challenges for racing drivers anywhere in the world.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>It’s hard to stop the goose bumps from prickling as you walk around one of the great cathedrals of
                motorsport, while in terms of atmosphere, the British fans are always reliably raucous – this is the
                country that invented football (that’s soccer, mind), after all.

            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>The Becketts grandstand has to rank highly on the ultimate list of places to watch an F1 car in action –
                believe us, your eyes will be on stalks when you see how quickly the drivers zip through Maggotts and
                Becketts. Further along the track, the Stowe grandstands will place you at one of the best overtaking
                spots, while watching the drivers chuck their cars into that corner on their own is nearly as good.

            <h2>Hungary - Budapest </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trackone">
            <img src="../imagines/circuit/hungary.avif" alt="hungary circuit" width="400">

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 4.381km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 70</li>
                <li>Race distance: 306.630km</li>
                <li>Lap record: 1:17.103 - Max Verstappen (2019)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Work began on the Hungaroring in 1985, and the track was race-ready just nine months later. The Hungarian
                government had originally considered reviving the old Nepliget park circuit in Budapest in a bid to host
                Formula 1 in the country, but in the end decided to create a purpose-built facility instead.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>The year was 1986. Nelson Piquet won the first F1 race around the Hungaroring, famously slithering his
                Williams around the outside of Ayrton Senna’s Lotus to take the lead.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>The lack of straights at the Hungaroring often sees it compared to a karting circuit – and it’s true, the
                resemblance is uncanny. With several series of corners to string together, teams opt for Monaco levels
                of downforce, with a well-sorted chassis tending to be rewarded over horsepower given the short
                straights on offer. It’s a challenge many of the drivers relish, however, with finding a good rhythm key
                to setting fast lap times.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Hungary in July is usually hot hot hot. The good news if you’re at the track, though, is that there’s a
                water park close by – the Mogyorodi Aquarena vizi szorakoztatopark – which should be a good place to
                cool off. Away from aqueous activities, the circuit is only 20km from Budapest, putting you close to one
                of Europe’s most fascinating, storied and lively city centres.

            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>The track is built in a natural bowl, a bit like the UK's Brands Hatch. That means that any of the
                grandstands located on or around the main straight should provide a view of other parts of the track
                too, giving you more F1 bang for your, er, forint.

            <h2>Netherlands - Zandvoort </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trackone">
            <img src="../imagines/circuit/netherlands.avif" alt="netherlands circuit" width="400">

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 4.259km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 72</li>
                <li>Race distance: 306.648km</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Like Silverstone, Zandvoort was first opened in 1948, part of the wave of post-war motorsport enthusiasm
                that swept across Europe. Originally made up of a mixture of permanent track and public roads that
                snaked through the sand dunes of the Zandvoort resort town, the Dutch Automobile Racing Club – who
                initiated the plans for the circuit – brought in 1927 Le Mans winner Sammy Davis to consult on the
                layout for the original 4.2km track.
                </h3>
            <p>Formula 1 arrived in the Dutch dunes in 1952, with Alberto Ascari dominating the race as he led home a
                1-2-3 for Ferrari. Formula 1 would go on to race on and off at the track until 1985 – before, in 2019,
                the announcement came that the championship would return to Zandvoort for 2020, after a 35-year hiatus.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>‘Really quick’, ‘pretty insane’, ‘crazy’ and ‘old-school’ were words used by the current crop of F1
                drivers when asked to describe the Zandvoort track that many of them tackled in their junior category
                days. We’d also add ‘undulating’ to that list. The Zandvoort track swoops and flows through the sand
                dunes, creating a rollercoaster-like feel to the lap. And while the circuit will be modernised in time
                for F1’s 2020 return – including increasing the banking angle at the famous Tarzan corner to an
                Indianapolis Motor Speedway-trumping 18 degrees – Zandvoort will remain a proper, challenging drivers’
                track.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Zandvoort combines a lot of enticing features for an F1 fan. There’s the historic track, which famously
                featured in John Frankenheimer’s Grand Prix, and was the scene of many great F1 moments over the years
                (Gilles Villeneuve’s three-wheeled lap, anyone?). There’s the atmosphere, which with Max Verstappen on
                the grid is set to be electric, and most definitely orange-hued. And then there’s the beachside
                location, just a 30-minute train ride outside of Amsterdam. What’s not to love?

            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>We recommend taking to either the first turn at Tarzan, or to one of the banked corners, either at Arie
                Luyendijkbocht – the final turn on the track – or Hugenholtzbocht. For F1’s 2020 return, the latter
                corner will be both widened and banked into a parabolic corner, to allow cars to run side by side, and
                at the same speed, through it. Should be exciting…

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Constructed in just 110 days in 1922, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza was the world’s third purpose-built
                race track, coming after Brooklands in the UK and Indianapolis in the US. Like those two tracks, the
                original circuit featured a daunting series of banked curves, as well as much of the ‘outfield’ section
                that’s still in use today.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Monza opened its doors on September 3 1922, just a week before it hosted that year’s Italian Grand Prix.
                It was then part of the original Formula 1 calendar in 1950, and has held the Italian Grand Prix every
                year bar one since.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Rapido! Formula 1’s fastest ever lap was set at Monza – Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya’s 260.6km/h
                effort during practice for the 2004 Grand Prix – which should give you some idea of the nature of the
                track the locals call ‘La Pista Magica’. Cars are on full throttle for 80% of the lap, and hit their
                Vmax on the circuit’s 1.1km start/finish straight. From there, they roar off into the historic park
                section, where a series of big stops into tight chicanes give the brakes a good workout.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>The parkland setting of Monza, located just to the north east of Italy’s fashion capital Milan, makes for
                a relaxed, leafy setting for a Grand Prix, while the preserved Monza banking – spot it in the background
                as the cars exit the Parabolica, as well as on the flyover bridge they pass under en route to the
                Variante Ascari – leaves you in no doubt that you’re in the presence of a very special race track.

            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Aim for the grandstand at the Variante del Rettifilo to witness the awesome spectacle of cars braking
                from around 350km/h to just 70km/h before negotiating the tight chicane. This is also one of the track’s
                best overtaking spots, as well as a magnet for first-lap tussles.

                <li>Lap record: 1:43.009 - Leclerc (2019)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>It wasn’t – Baku is the newest street circuit on the Formula 1 calendar, joining the ranks of Monaco,
                Melbourne and Singapore.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>The first Grand Prix in Baku was held in 2016, as the European Grand Prix. That was followed by the
                inaugural Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017, which witnessed one of the biggest upsets of the season, with
                Daniel Ricciardo winning out from Valtteri Bottas and the Williams of Lance Stroll, while Lewis Hamilton
                and Sebastian Vettel engaged in some argy-bargy behind the Safety Car.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>A mixture of wide and open and tight and twisty. The lonnnnng main straight along the Baku shoreline is a
                slipstreaming mecca, and with cars able to run three abreast into Turn 1, the action often looks more
                IndyCar than F1. However from there, the track loops around into the city’s narrow, winding Icheri
                Sheher old town, dramatically wending past Baku’s medieval city walls. As in Monaco, slightest mistakes
                are punished quickly and severely, while set-up wise, the teams are forced to choose between downforce
                for the twisty bits and less drag for the straight.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>As with all city tracks, spectating at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix means that you’re right in the middle of
                the action when the cars get put back in their boxes. Baku itself is a buzzing city, while food is a key
                part of Azerbaijan’s culture, incorporating elements of Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine – so eat up!

            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>The principal Absheron grandstand at the end of the main straight should be high up on your viewing
                wish-list, as you’ll be watching the cars braking from around 350km/h into the 90-degree Turn 1 – and
                you’ll likely get to watch the lion’s share of overtaking too. Elsewhere, the Icheri Sheher grandstand
                provides a unique vantage point, as you watch the cars wriggle through the city gate section and power
                on down to the super-fast Turn 13-15 complex.

                <li>Lap record: 1:41.905 - K. Magnussen (2018)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The Marina Bay Circuit arrived on the scene in 2008. A street track with the city's famous skyline as its
                spectacular backdrop, the initial circuit plan by Herman Tilke was refined by KBR Inc, while the event
                has quickly established itself as one of the standouts on the F1 calendar.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>In 2008, Singapore had the honour of hosting the first night-time race in F1 history. The Grand Prix –
                the 15th round of that season – proved a huge hit with the teams and drivers, while Renault’s Fernando
                Alonso claimed a controversial victory.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>The 5.063km Marina Bay Circuit is one of the most physically demanding on the calendar, its bumpy street
                surface coupled with humid conditions giving the drivers plenty to think about. With 23 corners, they
                are working the wheel a lot, too, around the high-speed lap – the physical stress causing them to lose
                as much as 3kg over the course of a race. The circuit also boasts some of the most unique features of
                any track on the F1 calendar, including Turn 18, which actually sees the drivers pass underneath a
                grandstand.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>If you want to see Singapore at its best, there’s no better time to do so than when Formula 1 arrives in
                the heart of this buzzing city. Get the lay of the land by taking a ride on the Singapore Flyer, a giant
                Ferris wheel overlooking the track’s permanent pits complex, then get stuck into Singapore’s incredible
                bar and restaurant scene. Cocktail fanatics should also make a pilgrimage to the famous Raffles Hotel –
                the proper home of the Singapore Sling (non-alcoholic versions are available!)
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Get yourself comfy in the grandstand located at Turn 1, which offers spectacular views as the cars
                accelerate into the first corner, before braking hard and whipping through Turns 2 and 3. You’ll get a
                great view of the start too – expect to see plenty of sparks fly as the drivers blast off the line.

            <ul>
                <li>Circuit length: 5.513km</li>
                <li>Number of laps: 56</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The Circuit of The Americas, designed by Hermann Tilke in collaboration with American architectural firm
                HKS, endured something of a nervy start, with construction suffering several setbacks. It was well worth
                the wait, though, when 1978 F1 champion Mario andretti opened the track on October 21 2012.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>F1 first raced at the Circuit of The Americas in 2012, for the first United States Grand Prix since the
                2007 race at Indianapolis. Unsurprisingly, over 100,000 spectators packed out the Austin venue,
                witnessing Lewis Hamilton’s last ever win in a McLaren before his switch to Mercedes for 2013.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>If the corners at COTA seem familiar, they should be. Turns 3 through 6 look not dissimilar to
                Silverstone's high-speed run through Maggotts/Becketts or the S Curves at Suzuka, while Turns 12 through
                15 mimic Hockenheim's stadium section. Meanwhile, the uphill run into wide, wide Turn 1 – hey,
                everything’s bigger in Texas, right? – has provided some fine overtaking action in the track’s short
                life.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>There’s a reason Austin is often regarded as America’s coolest city, with great food and a vibrant
                nightlife, all united under the banner of the city’s unofficial slogan: ‘Keep Austin Weird’. Then when
                racing starts, you’ll be in attendance at one of the great modern race tracks. With the Americans’
                attitude to partying, you won’t want to miss out!
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>You’re spoilt for choice. If you sit in the main grandstand on the start-finish straight you’ll get – in
                true US style – the benefit of an in-seat food and drinks service, while those in the stand at Turn 1
                enjoy a view all the way to downtown Austin. But if you want to see the racing action up close, find a
                way into the the Stadium Section stands at Turns 15/16.

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>In 1959. The father of Mexico’s most famous racing brothers, Ricardo and Pedro Rodriguez, was an advisor
                to Mexican President Adolfo Lopez Mateo, and had a word in his boss’s ear about building a racing
                circuit in Mexico City’s Magdalena Mixiuhca sports park using the existing internal roads. El Presidente
                liked the idea, and work on the track was completed in under a year.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Formula 1 cars arrived in 1962 for a non-championship race, returning the following year for a proper,
                bona fide Grand Prix. That 1963 race was won by Jim Clark, while for the next few years, Mexico’s fiesta
                vibes meant it became the traditional season-ender for Formula 1. Mexico was welcomed back onto the F1
                calendar in 2015.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>High up! The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits over 2km above sea level, making the 4.3km lap a
                breathless experience. The track still largely follows the outline of the original 1959 circuit, the
                main difference being that the spectacular – and spectacularly scary – Peralta corner is now bisected,
                with the circuit instead winding through the old Foro Sol baseball stadium, providing one F1’s most
                unique vistas.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Mexico City is one of the world’s most buzzing, vibrant metropolises. And with the Autodromo Hermanos
                Rodriguez located just to the east of the city, with a metro station ready to whip you into the downtown
                at the end of each day’s racing action, the Mexican Grand Prix is a fantastic chance to properly mix
                sport and culture.
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Fight tooth and nail for a spot in the Foro Sol. Not only will you get to peer down into the cockpits of
                the drivers as they pass through the stadium, but the atmosphere when the podium ceremony unfolds there
                has to be experienced to be believed.

                <li>Lap record: 1:10.540 - Bottas (2018)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>Building work began on what ended up being called the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace – but what is more
                commonly referred to as Interlagos – all the way back in 1938. The track designers took their
                inspiration from three main circuits: Brooklands in the UK, Roosevelt Raceway in the USA and Montlhery
                in France.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Buoyed by the success of Brazil’s Emerson Fittipaldi, Formula 1 first jetted into Interlagos for a world
                championship race in 1973. Fans were treated to a home win in the first three Brazilian Grands Prix,
                with Fittipaldi victorious in 1973 and 1974, while Carlos Pace won in 1975.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Like many pre-World War II tracks, Interlagos features banked corners, with the drivers beginning their
                lap on a sort of half oval – in fact, between 1957 and the track’s return to the F1 calendar in 1990,
                Interlagos could be run as a giant oval. After wiggling through the Senna S and down to Turn 4, the
                drivers then go through a snaking in-field section with some challenging camber changes, before slinging
                back up the hill and through the banked final turn.</p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>A carnival atmosphere really does dominate in Brazil, and watching Formula 1 cars alongside the locals is
                something every F1 fan should experience. True, it doesn’t look like there’ll be a local driver to cheer
                on any time soon, but that won’t stop the party at Interlagos.
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Because of the bowl-like nature of the track, a place in Grandstand A on the banked entry to the
                start-finish straight will give you a double whammy of views, allowing you to see the cars winding
                through the infield section and then passing underneath you. On the other end of the straight,
                Grandstand M will put you on top of the first corner and the Senna S, the best spot to watch overtakes
                on the track.

            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The 2023 Formula 1 season sees drivers tackle an all-new circuit in Las Vegas, encompassing the very best
                the City of Lights has to offer – including the famous Strip.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>Las Vegas previously staged two F1 races – under the Caesars Palace Grand Prix moniker – in 1981 and
                1982. It played host to the season finale on both occasions, with Williams driver Alan Jones winning the
                1981 race and Michele Alboreto taking his maiden F1 victory for Tyrrell at the 1982 encounter.
                Meanwhile, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg clinched the title in ’81 and ’82 respectively with
                fifth-place finishes.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Located in the heart of Las Vegas, the new 6.2km, 17-turn street circuit winds its way past iconic
                locations like Caesars Palace, the Bellagio and the Venetian. With average speeds expected to match
                Monza, otherwise known as F1’s ‘Temple of Speed’, there promises to be plenty of action and overtaking.
            </p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>There’s already a huge buzz building around the Las Vegas Grand Prix, fuelled by a 2022 launch event that
                gave drivers and fans a glimpse of what’s to come. With the party atmosphere the resort city is famous
                for, a Saturday night race under the lights and entertainment off track to match the action on it, this
                will be one the events to attend in 2023.
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>A host of ticketing options are available for the Las Vegas weekend, ranging from VIP packages to
                grandstand seating and general admission. But whatever you go for, a spectacular experience awaits – as
                cars blast around a high-speed circuit set against one of the most vibrant backdrops F1 has ever seen.

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>The Losail International Circuit, located on the outskirts of the capital city of Doha, was built in
                preparation for hosting Qatar’s first ever MotoGP event in 2004, with the circuit completed in just over
                a year.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>2021 represents the first time Qatar has ever hosted the FIA Formula One World Championship – with the
                country signing an additional 10-year deal to host the sport from 2023.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>Designed primarily with motorcycle racing in mind, the 5.4-kilometre Losail International Circuit is a
                fast and flowing track, where medium- and high-speed corners predominate. Over one kilometre of the
                track’s total length is made up of the main straight, which provides plenty of overtaking opportunities
                into Turn 1.
            </p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>If you live in the northern hemisphere and the thought of escaping colder climes in November appeals,
                you’ll be well catered for in Qatar, with average temperatures around 28 degrees Celsius at that time of
                year. Unsurprisingly with that kind of weather, Qatar is a great country for outdoor pursuits, be that
                karting at Losail itself, or trips into the desert to go sandboarding, camel riding and 4x4ing.
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>The grandstand at the exit of Turn 10 gives fans the chance to watch the cars blasting through this
                dynamic section of the track, pitching right through the fast kink of Turn 9 and into the Turn 10
                braking zone.

            </ul>
            <h3>When was the track built?</h3>
            <p>In 2006, plans were announced to develop Yas Island, located just to the east of Abu Dhabi, into a new
                tourist destination, with a major part of the plans centring around a 5.5km race track. The diggers
                rolled into what would become the Yas Marina Circuit in May 2007, with the project completed by October
                2009.</p>
            <h3>When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p>In 2009. The track debuted as that year’s Formula 1 season finale, with Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel
                winning from team mate Mark Webber and the already-crowned 2009 champion Jenson Button. Vettel would go
                on to secure his first title in Abu Dhabi a year later, amid much crying.
            </p>
            <h3>What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p>The Hermann Tilke-designed track is dominated by its 1.2km straight between Turns 5 and 6 – which, with slow-speed corners marking its beginning and end, makes it a honeypot for overtaking moves. Other highlights include the tricky run through Turns 10 and 11 into 12, which forces the drivers to brake hard with bags of lateral load still on the car. Track modifications ahead of the 2021 race, shortening the lap slightly to 5.28km, have only added to its excitement.
            </p>
            <h3>Why go?</h3>
            <p>Yas Island was a blank canvas for developers to turn into a tourist attraction, and 11 years and $40 billion later, they’ve nearly finished doing just that. Seven hotels, Ferrari’s indoor theme park, a mall, a water park, a golf course, a beach, a concert arena and a nightclub, all framed by perfect Emirati weather. What more could you want?
            </p>
            <h3>Where is the best place to watch?</h3>
            <p>Assuming you can’t get a room with a trackside view in the spectacular whale-shaped Yas Hotel – or a berth in a boat’s cabin in the marina – opt for a spot in the West Grandstand, a great place to watch all the overtaking action into Turn 6. Or if you’re more there for the atmos, stick yourself in the Main Grandstand overlooking the start-finish straight and enjoy Abu Dhabi’s famed pyrotechnics. It might be worth trying to get a seat high up in whatever grandstand you choose, though, if you’re looking to keep out of the sun.
